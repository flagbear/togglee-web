      <p>
        I have been working in the industry for many years and implemented over and over again feature flags code. <br/>
        Over the last few years I have been happy to see the grow of new projects that allow developers to manage feature rollout in real time.<br />
        Hope Toggle can help to fill that space, any feedback will be Welcome.
