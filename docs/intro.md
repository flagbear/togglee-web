# Welcome

Welcome to the Togglee user guide! This guide shows you how to get started creating feature toggles for your application in multiple languages.

## What is Togglee?

Togglee is a set of libraries that enable the use of feature toggles in different development languages with one set of toggle definition. It's different to other technologies as it does not depend on a service to serve this content but actually relies on plain text files server over the internet or your servers through a URL (ex. gist).


## Is Togglee for me?

If you have a CI/CD environment where you expect to release changes continuesly feature toggles are a good practice to separate deployment from activation. Toggle will allow you to activate or revert changes in the speed you have configured.


## Ready to get started?

Find out how to define and use your toggles in [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start). Or visit the [page](https://www.togglee.com/) and [its repo](https://github.com/togglee/) and start exploring!
